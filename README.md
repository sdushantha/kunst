```kunst``` is a deamon that extracts the album art from the songs playing in ```mpd``` and displays them in the a little window. It doesn't loop on a timer, instead it waits for ```mpd``` to send a ```player``` event. When it receives a ```player``` event, it wakes up and extracts the album art of the current playing track. This makes ```kunst```really lightweight and makes it idle at ```~0%``` CPU usage. If there no embbeded album art, it will try to fetch the album art from the internet.
